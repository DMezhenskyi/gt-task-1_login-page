I also removed dist folder form .gitignore so you can find compiled bundles under root directory.
Source code was build with -prod and -aot flags.

## Development server
Run `npm install`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
